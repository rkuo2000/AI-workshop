## SAE Levels of Autonomy
The [Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)](https://www.sae.org) divided levels of driving automation into 6 categories, ranging from 0 (fully manual) to 5 (fully autonomous).
![](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/gallery/cm/articles/news/2018/12/j3016-levels-of-driving-automation-12-10.jpg)

[https://aboutselfdriving.com/](https://aboutselfdriving.com/)<br>

* **Level 0:** No Automation<br>
The cars we are normally driving right now. The driver performs all driving tasks with zero autonomy.

* **Level 1:** Driver Assistance<br>
Drivers are still driving, but they could be assisted by the car on one task. Examples include automatic braking or auto-steering.

* **Level 2:** Partial Automation<br>
The cars would have at least two automated functions. The car can drive completely on its own in specific situations such as parking.

* **Level 3:** Conditional Automation<br>
The car can handle “dynamic driving tasks” but still needs instantaneous intervention when the car requests. It is not equipped with a fail-safe yet.

* **Level 4:** High Automation<br>
The level that many companies aim for nowadays. The cars are officially driverless under certain conditions.

* **Level 5:** Full Automation<br>
The vehicle is able to perform all driving functions under all conditions. Some might even get rid of the steering wheels.

### automakers/software companies
There are mainly three aspects of self-driving in the industry right now, consumer cars, robo-taxi, and driverless trucking. 
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/0*2WgF4DAKrbH3m12n.jpg)

* **Robo-Taxi**<br>
Basically, a robo-taxi is an Uber without a driver. That being said, a robo-taxi is clearly an L4 or L5-level self-driving car, which is the ultimate futuristic smart city goal of humanity. It would optimize the rideshare network. People would no longer have to keep a car themselves nor do they worry about the traffic jam getting to work.

Current companies working on it include but are not limited to Waymo, AutoX, Cruise, DiDi, Pony.ai, Zoox, Aurora, Motional, Optimus Ride (acquired by Magna), Tesla, Baidu, etc. Specifically, Waymo is the first to open up its public driverless taxi program in Pheonix in 2020. AutoX opened Its Fully Driverless RoboTaxi Service to the Public in China around Jan 2021, and Cruise recently (Feb 2022) opened up its driverless cars in San Francisco to the public. On a side note, Ford- and VW- backed Argo AI just got shut down on Oct. 27th, 2022.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*zid7mO7tzjX_2L3a)

* **Consumer Cars**<br>
The leading company in this realm is no doubt Tesla, which has been selling millions of its self-manufactured vehicles all over the world. Tesla has also released its Full Self-driving (FSD) software based on subscription to help drivers navigate through urban areas. Not to be tricked by the name though, as the system is still a level 2. Xpeng is also doing quite well in China, a main competitor of Tesla. Other competitors include but are not limited to Mobileye, Nvidia, Apple, GM, Ford, Volvo, Qualcomm, etc.
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/0*7KhO-yyfkETmwSnB)

* **Driverless Trucking**<br>
The leading companies include but are not limited to Aurora, TuSimple, Embark Trucks, and Daimler Truck.

* **Traffic manager.** A built-in system that takes control of the vehicles besides the one used for learning. It acts as a conductor provided by CARLA to recreate urban-like environments with realistic behaviours.
* **Sensors.** Vehicles rely on them to dispense information of their surroundings. In CARLA they are a specific kind of actor attached the vehicle and the data they receive can be retrieved and stored to ease the process. Currently the project supports different types of these, from cameras to radars, lidar and many more.
* **Recorder.** This feature is used to reenact a simulation step by step for every actor in the world. It grants access to any moment in the timeline anywhere in the world, making for a great tracing tool.
* **ROS bridge** and Autoware implementation. As a matter of universalization, the CARLA project ties knots and works for the integration of the simulator within other learning environments.
* **Open assets.** CARLA facilitates different maps for urban settings with control over weather conditions and a blueprint library with a wide set of actors to be used. However, these elements can be customized and new can be generated following simple guidelines.
Scenario runner. In order to ease the learning process for vehicles,

### [Reinforcement Learning in AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/reinforcement_learning/)
The simulation needs to be up and running before you execute dqn_car.py!!!

1. Keep AirSim Env running first<br>
`cd AirSimNH/LinuxNoEditor` <br>
`./AirSimNH.sh -ResX=640 -ResY=480 -windowed`<br>
(For Windows, click AirSimNH.exe to run, **Alt-Enter** will switch to windowed mode)

2. To train DQN model for 500,000 eposides [(RL with Car)](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/tree/master/PythonClient/reinforcement_learning)<br>
&ensp;Open a Terminal on Linux / run Git-Bash on Windows<br>
`pip install gym`<br>
`pip install stable-baselines3`<br>
`cd ~`<br>
`git clone https://github.com/rkuo2000/AirSim` <br>
`cd ~/AirSim/PythonClient/reinforcement_learning` <br>
`python dqn_car.py` <br>

### [Kaggle: AirSim End-to-End Learning](https://kaggle.com/rkuo2000/airsim-end-to-end-learning)

#### Build Model with input image and state (driving angle)
```
image_input_shape = sample_batch_train_data[0].shape[1:]
state_input_shape = sample_batch_train_data[1].shape[1:]

#Create the convolutional stacks
pic_input = layers.Input(shape=image_input_shape)

x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(pic_input)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)

#Inject the state input
state_input = layers.Input(shape=state_input_shape)
m = layers.concatenate([x, state_input])

# Add a few dense layers to finish the model
m = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(m)
m = layers.Dropout(0.2)(m)
m = layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')(m)
m = layers.Dropout(0.2)(m)
m = layers.Dense(1)(m)

model = models.Model(inputs=[pic_input, state_input], outputs=m)

model.summary()
```
